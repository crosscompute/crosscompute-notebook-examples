    "Lifelong learning is especially important in rapidly changing fields like computer science. However, when providing technical instruction, showing participants how to teach themselves is a critical skill that is often overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this workshop is to practice a structure that instills habits for lifelong learning by writing journals, completing small projects and teaching others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation to learn starts from within, and we believe the best way to personalize that motivation is to have participants keep a journal of their goals and lessons. Next, we will work on designing exercises that build confidence in completing small projects and building useful tools. Finally, we will rehearse techniques for teaching each other."
